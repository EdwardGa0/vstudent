# VStudent

VStudent is a new way to create a classroom environment online with abilites to lower and increase volumes. You can listen in on your peers or have the familiar classroom background sound we all expeienced in university.

## About the Project
During the coronavirus pandemic, many schools found themselves to move online, with lively classroom environments reduced professers talking to themselves.
We want to bring back the classroom environmnet by allowing users to talk to within a group while creating an effect of chatter in the background for others.
This gets rid of the awkward pauses within our online classrooms and allows the professer to know that he/her still has students within the lecture.

## Code
The final verion of code is within the temp branch.
This was created using Vonage API and React.

If you want to try it out for yourself: [VStudent](https://vstudent-client.herokuapp.com/)
